Coding Style
============

* Use ```-``` for multiple-word selectors
* Use soft-tabs with 2 space indent
* Put spaces after ```:``` in property declarations
* Put spaces before ```{``` in rule declarations
* Use single line for one rule declaration, multiple lines for multiple declarations
* ALWAYS add a semicolon after a property declaration

```css
.styleguide-format {
  border: 1px solid #000;
  margin: 0 auto; 
}

.single-line { color: #000; }
```
